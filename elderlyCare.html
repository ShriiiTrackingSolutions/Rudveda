        <p>
         Aging gracefully is possible with Ayurveda’s nurturing approach to elderly care. As the body ages, it experiences decreased strength, joint stiffness, poor digestion, and cognitive decline—symptoms often linked to aggravated Vata. Ayurvedic therapies like Abhyangam (herbal oil massage) promote circulation and reduce stiffness, while Kati Basti and Spine Basti offer targeted relief to the lower back and spine, areas prone to pain in seniors. Nasyam supports mental clarity and helps reduce issues like sinus congestion and memory decline. Janu Basti strengthens knee joints, improving mobility. These treatments not only offer physical relief but also bring emotional balance and mental calmness. Tailored for individual constitution and age-related needs, Ayurvedic elderly care encourages vitality, better sleep, and a sense of dignity—ensuring that seniors remain active, pain-free, and deeply connected to their well-being.

          <p>Ayurvedic Massage, known as the Abhyanga or Abhyangam, is one of the most important dincharyas (daily regimen) mentioned in the classics for achieving good health and longevity. It includes a full body massage done using herbal oils that have several health benefits. Experts believe that many of the prevalent modern-day massage techniques are the modified forms of Abhyangam.</p>
          <p>The health benefits of Abhyangham-massage are mentioned in the Ancient Ayurvedic text Ashtanga Hridaya. It is believed to prevent Ageing, reduce Fatigue, and also diminish the effects of aggravated Vata Dosha.</p>

          <p>Abhyangam can be performed in several classical positions. At Rudveda, it is done in 7 different classical positions with long flowing strokes. Some Ayurvedic centres perform it in 4 positions. The number of strokes used and amount of pressure applied during massage varies based on the individual’s requirements and ‘Prakriti.’ The herbal oil used for it is customised as per the patient’s Prakriti and presenting conditions. Ayurvedic Massage can be performed as a stand-alone therapy or as a precursor to other therapy regimen; it can be performed by a single therapist or by two therapists working in synchronisation.</p>
          <h2 class="therdH mt-4">What Are the Types of Ayurvedic Massage?</h2>
          <p>Ayurvedic massages use synchronised motions to stimulate nerve endings to increase blood circulation, thereby channelising early elimination of toxins from the body.
