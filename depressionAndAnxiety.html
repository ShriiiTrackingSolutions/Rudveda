        <p>
          Depression and anxiety are among the most common mental health challenges today, often caused by stress, lifestyle imbalance, and emotional strain. Ayurveda offers holistic therapies that not only address symptoms but also focus on the root cause by restoring harmony between mind and body. Treatments like Abhyangam (therapeutic oil massage) and Pizhichil (warm oil therapy) deeply relax the nervous system, reducing mental fatigue. Nasyam, which involves administering medicated oils through the nose, helps clear the mind and balance hormones. Shirodhara, a calming stream of warm oil poured onto the forehead, induces a meditative state and soothes the brain. Together, these therapies help manage emotional disturbances naturally, promoting mental clarity, better sleep, and emotional stability. Ayurveda supports mental well-being without side effects, offering a safe path to inner peace and emotional resilience.

          <p>Ayurvedic Massage, known as the Abhyanga or Abhyangam, is one of the most important dincharyas (daily regimen) mentioned in the classics for achieving good health and longevity. It includes a full body massage done using herbal oils that have several health benefits. Experts believe that many of the prevalent modern-day massage techniques are the modified forms of Abhyangam.</p>
          <p>The health benefits of Abhyangham-massage are mentioned in the Ancient Ayurvedic text Ashtanga Hridaya. It is believed to prevent Ageing, reduce Fatigue, and also diminish the effects of aggravated Vata Dosha.</p>
          <h2 class="therdH mt-4">How is Ayurvedic Massage Performed?</h2>
          <p>Abhyangam can be performed in several classical positions. At Rudveda, it is done in 7 different classical positions with long flowing strokes. Some Ayurvedic centres perform it in 4 positions. The number of strokes used and amount of pressure applied during massage varies based on the individual’s requirements and ‘Prakriti.’ The herbal oil used for it is customised as per the patient’s Prakriti and presenting conditions. Ayurvedic Massage can be performed as a stand-alone therapy or as a precursor to other therapy regimen; it can be performed by a single therapist or by two therapists working in synchronisation.</p>
          <h2 class="therdH mt-4">What Are the Types of Ayurvedic Massage?</h2>
          <p>Ayurvedic massages use synchronised motions to stimulate nerve endings to increase blood circulation, thereby channelising early elimination of toxins from the body. The herbs in the medicated oils rejuvenate the tissue and play a vital role in the elimination of toxins and bring a feeling of wellbeing. The lukewarm herbal oil used in Ayurvedic massage stimulates nerve endings thereby improving peripheral blood circulation. The specific long flowing strokes improve the lymphatic flow and promote early elimination of toxins from the body.</p>

Then they evacuate the morbidity present or distributed in nearby area. Thus it relieves the blockage of the channels and the diseases are cured effectively. Medicated oils / juices / powders stimulate the vital centres of brain to overcome specific diseases.

              <p>Shirodhara massage is a classic Ayurvedic therapy, which includes pouring of warm herbal oil on the forehead in a continuous stream. Ayurvedic Shirodhara therapy is very effective in promoting sound sleep and reducing stress. Shirodhara treatment is one among the Bahiparimarjana chikitsa, or external treatments told in Ayurveda. The term Shirodhara comes from two words “Shira” meaning head and “Dhara” meaning stream.</p>
              <h2 class="therdH mt-4">We briefly explain Shirodhara Massage - Treatment, Benefits & Side effects.</h2> 
              <p>How Does Shirodhara Massage Treatment Work?
                Pouring of warm oils used stimulates and soothes the hypothalamus, thereby regulating the functions of the pituitary gland and inducing sleep. Shirodhara stimulates Marma’s or Vital Points in the head and improves circulation. The warm oils used for Shirodhara also cause vasodilatation of all the channels and thereby improve the blood circulation of the brain. Shirodhara also reduces the level of stress hormones such as Adrenaline and Noradrenaline and thus relaxes the mind.</p>
              <h2 class="therdH mt-4">Shirodhara Massage Therapy - Stepwise Procedure</h2> 
              <p>Shirodhara is usually practised in the morning or evening. Depending on the ‘Dravya’ (medicated or non-medicated liquids), it can be called as Tailadhara, Takradhara, Kashayadhara and Jaladhara. Shirodhara is also included as one among the Murdhataila (four special procedures in Ayurveda for the head).</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Shirodhara massage treatment begins with Abhyangam (Ayurvedic body massage).</li>
                <li>You need to lie down on the massage table with closed eyes and relax your body.</li>
                <li>Shirodhara starts with the pouring of about 2 litres lukewarm oil continuously as a stream on to the forehead in an oscillating manner.</li>
                <li>The time duration of Shirodhara treatment may extend from 30 to 60 minutes depending on the condition of the patient. It is important to make sure that the oil does not enter eyes or ears and is therefore recommended to be performed by an experienced therapist</li>
                <li>You may also be given a mild head massage before or during Shirodhara. Shirodhara may also include pouring of buttermilk, decoctions or even water.</li>
              </ol>
