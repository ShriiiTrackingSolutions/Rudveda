     <p class="fifthH">Panchakarma is one of the best natural Ayurvedic therapies for Detoxification that expels body toxins through different therapies. Human body is like a machine and the way a machine needs cleaning and lubrication from time to time to improve the efficiency and quality, our body also needs cleansing from time to time. With the modern life being full of tensions and turmoil, there is limited scope for relaxation. Further lack of physical activity, consumption of unhealthy foods, and habits such as smoking or drinking alcohol are responsible for increasing toxin levels in the body. This build-up of toxins is a precursor to several chronic illnesses such as diabetes, heart diseases, and even cancer. To prevent the risk of these illnesses we need to regularly eliminate toxins from the body which can be easily achieved through regular Panchakarma treatment.</p>

<h2 class="therdH">Who Should Avoid Panchakarma?</h2>
<p>There is no specific reason to avoid Panchkarma by anyone. It can be administered to healthy persons (Swastha) and as well as diseased persons (Atura). However, extra precautions are taken while offering Panchkarma therapy to people who are above 70 and children below age of 7, as some of the therapies could make them uncomfortable. When done through skilled hands, Panchkarma can be administered safety to people of any age.</p>
<p>
  It is also important to note that although Panchakarma term is suggestive of five therapies, the type and number of therapy offeref to every individual may differ. In simple words, based on your health status you may be offere d only 2-3 therapies under Panchakarma.
