        <p>
       Mental health is as vital as physical health, and Ayurveda offers a holistic, drug-free path to emotional balance. Treatments like Shirodhara and Ksheeradhara, where medicated liquids flow gently on the forehead, induce a deep meditative state, reducing anxiety, stress, and insomnia. Abhyangam and Padabhyangam ease nervous tension by stimulating key marma (energy) points. These therapies soothe the mind and regulate the body’s stress hormones. Ayurveda emphasizes balancing Vata dosha, which governs the nervous system and is often disturbed in mental health disorders. Customizing therapies with calming herbs, diet, and breathing practices enhances their benefits. This holistic approach not only addresses symptoms but nurtures emotional resilience and mental clarity. With regular care, individuals experience improved sleep, stabilized mood, and a restored sense of peace and purpose in daily life.

          <p>Ayurvedic Massage, known as the Abhyanga or Abhyangam, is one of the most important dincharyas (daily regimen) mentioned in the classics for achieving good health and longevity. It includes a full body massage done using herbal oils that have several health benefits. Experts believe that many of the prevalent modern-day massage techniques are the modified forms of Abhyangam.</p>
          <p>The health benefits of Abhyangham-massage are mentioned in the Ancient Ayurvedic text Ashtanga Hridaya. It is believed to prevent Ageing, reduce Fatigue, and also diminish the effects of aggravated Vata Dosha.</p>
          <h2 class="therdH mt-4">How is Ayurvedic Massage Performed?</h2>
          <p>Abhyangam can be performed in several classical positions. At Rudveda, it is done in 7 different classical positions with long flowing strokes. Some Ayurvedic centres perform it in 4 positions. The number of strokes used and amount of pressure applied during massage varies based on the individual’s requirements and ‘Prakriti.’ The herbal oil used for it is customised as per the patient’s Prakriti and presenting conditions. Ayurvedic Massage can be performed as a stand-alone therapy or as a precursor to other therapy regimen; it can be performed by a single therapist or by two therapists working in synchronisation.</p>
          <h2 class="therdH mt-4">What Are the Types of Ayurvedic Massage?</h2>
          <p>Ayurvedic massages use synchronised motions to stimulate nerve endings to increase blood circulation, thereby channelising early elimination of toxins from the body. The herbs in the medicated oils rejuvenate the tissue and play a vital role in the elimination of toxins and bring a feeling of wellbeing. The lukewarm herbal oil used in Ayurvedic massage stimulates nerve endings thereby improving peripheral blood circulation. The specific long flowing strokes improve the lymphatic flow and promote early elimination of toxins from the body.</p>
          <ol>
            <li><span><strong>Sarvanga </strong></span><strong>A<span>bhyangam</span>:</strong> It is performed on the entire body.

Sarvanga Abhyangam is done by more than one therapist by applying warm oils all over the patient’s body in seven different positions that are- sitting, lying on back, right lateral, lying on stomach, left lateral, lying on the back, sitting. This Ayurvedic massage involves the application of the right amount of pressure and synchronised circular movements to provide you with a number of health benefits.</li>

Shirodhara is also included as one among the Murdhataila (four special procedures in Ayurveda for the head).</p>

                      <li>You need to lie down on the massage table with closed eyes and relax your body.</li>
                      <li>Shirodhara starts with the pouring of about 2 litres lukewarm oil continuously as a stream on to the forehead in an oscillating manner.</li>
                <li>The time duration of Shirodhara treatment may extend from 30 to 60 minutes depending on the condition of the patient. It is important to make sure that the oil does not enter eyes or ears and is therefore recommended to be performed by an experienced therapist</li>
                <li>You may also be given a mild head massage before or during Shirodhara. Shirodhara may also include pouring of buttermilk, decoctions or even water.</li>
